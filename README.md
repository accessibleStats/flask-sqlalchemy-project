# flask-sqlalchemy-project

This project provides a Python version 3.7 framework for a Flask application, using a (mainly) Bootstrap 5.2 frontend, SQLAlchemy for data management/transport,
and an SQLite3 database.

To use this framework: setup a virtual environment (instructions here https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/) and download dependencies.

Currently, the program contains various html pages, navigation logic, database/table creation, user management, and form/data validation. At this point, 
the project is pretty bare bones, but it has the potential to be converted into a personal blog, portfolio site, commerce page, etc.
